Atlantic Nitrogen is proud to be a certified "Woman Owned Small Business" (WOSB), a designation that highlights our company's ownership by a woman and our eligibility for certain government contracts and programs. Being a WOSB means that our company is owned, controlled, and operated by Kyle Dick. 

This certification acknowledges the significant role of women entrepreneurs in the business world and recognizes their contributions to economic growth and diversity. In the gas and oil industry, where traditionally male-dominated, the presence of women-owned businesses like Atlantic Nitrogen brings valuable perspectives, innovation, and expertise to the table. 

Women in the industry contribute to various aspects, from engineering and technology development to project management and leadership roles. Their involvement not only fosters diversity but also brings about a more inclusive and collaborative work environment. As the industry evolves, the importance of women in shaping its future cannot be overstated, as they bring unique insights and capabilities that drive progress and sustainability in the gas and oil sector.
